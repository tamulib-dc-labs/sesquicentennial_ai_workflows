# Experimental Tools for Sesquicentennial Workflows

The repository here includes experimental tools for generating hand written text and metadata about handwritten
documents for Sesquicentennial related works.

This is a work in progress but the idea is to write prompts as markdown (you can see those in `prompts`) and use Claude for HTR
and metadata generation.
